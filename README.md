# About
This is an extension for Visual Studio Code, which implements syntax highlighting for the [Markless](https://shirakumo.github.io/markless) markup language, as well as its extension for dialogue scripting, [Speechless](https://shirakumo.github.io/speechless).

The syntax will be active for files with the `.mess` and `.spess` extensions.
